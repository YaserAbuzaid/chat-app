This file is a deep explanation of your Express + Socket.IO codebase with comments, concepts, and key terms.

---

[ server.js ]

- express: Web framework to handle HTTP routing, middleware, and static files.
- express.static('public'): Middleware to serve files like HTML/CSS/JS from the "public" folder.
- app.listen(4000): Starts the HTTP server on port 4000.
- socket.io: Real-time bidirectional communication between server and clients.
- io.on('connect'): Listens for a client to connect.
- socket.emit('eventName', data): Sends an event to the client.
- socket.on('eventName', callback): Listens for an event from the client.
- socket.id: Unique ID assigned to each connected client.
- server sends a 'welcome' event to the client when it connects.
- server listens for 'thankyou' event back from the client.

---

[ scripts.js ]

- io('http://localhost:4000'): Connects to the Socket.IO server.
- socket.on('welcome', data => {...}): Listens for a 'welcome' event and logs the data.
- socket.emit('thankyou'): Sends a 'thankyou' event to the server.

Concepts:
- .on(): Receive named events.
- .emit(): Send named events.

[ index.html ]

- Loads socket.io.min.js: Provides io() function.
- Loads scripts.js after socket.io.
- Connects to the backend and handles incoming messages.

---

[ styles.css ]

- Adds margin and styling for inputs and lists.
- Alternating background for odd list items.
- Prepares UI for future use (e.g. chat display).

---

[ Middleware in Express ]

Middleware is any function that runs between receiving a request and sending a response.

Examples:
- express.static()
- express.json()
- Logging (morgan)
- Authentication checks

Signature: (req, res, next) => { ... }

Use next() to continue to the next handler.

[ Summary ]

- Express handles HTTP and static file serving.
- Socket.IO enables real-time messaging.
- .on(): listen for events.
- .emit(): send events.
- Middleware allows request preprocessing.
